Build: Install dependencies and compile the application to verify that the codebase is functional and free of build errors.
Test: Execute unit tests to ensure that individual components of the application function correctly.
Code Scanning: Perform static code analysis using SonarCloud to detect potential code quality issues, vulnerabilities, and maintainability concerns.
Dockerization: Build a Docker image of the application, scan it for vulnerabilities, and push the image to a Docker registry for deployment.
Acceptance Criteria
Reusable workflow is optional.
Code Scanning result must show in PR comments.
Container Scanning result must upload to GitHub Security tab via SARIF upload.
